`This is an under constrution post. If you have any comment it will be more than welcome.`

In the past months I found myself dicussing  about food with almost everyone every single day. Its clear that there is a rise of awareness but with it, it comes, a rise of confusion. The amount of noise about what is "right" or "wrong" is just insane. What to eat is probably the widdest discussed subject in our society and one of the biggest problems we face.

With this post I want to provide a macro prespective of food. Give fundamental arguments, distilled information and  provide resources that can be use as an overall guidance to take better decisions.

**I have no expertise on any of the related areas I'm about to touch. Don't trust me. Common sense and not-over-simplified information (aka books) are your best friends.** This blog post is just an starting point.

#What to eat

`Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.`
**-Leonardo da Vinci**

We are so perfect! We are the product of millions of years of natural evolution. Every part of our body is designed with a purpose.  So we must be designed to eat specific things.

I'll cover the most important concepts that define what should we eat and have a more impact on our health and lifes. Without doubt the first one is Ketosis.

##The magic of Ketosis
The benefits of Ketosis are so radical that I felt I was presenting an infocomercial when I was writting this. 

###What is ketosis?

    Ketosis /kɨˈtoʊsɨs/ is a metabolic state where most of the body's energy supply comes from ketone bodies in the blood, in contrast to a state of glycolysis where blood glucose provides most of the energy
    ...

    During the usual overnight fast the body's metabolism naturally switches into ketosis, and will switch back to glycolysis after a carbohydrate-rich meal. Longer-term ketosis may result from fasting or staying on a low-carbohydrate diet, and deliberately induced ketosis serves as a medical intervention for intractable epilepsy.In glycolysis higher levels of insulin promote storage of body fat and block release of fat from adipose tissues, while in ketosis fat reserves are readily released and consumed.For this reason ketosis is sometimes referred to as the body's "fat burning" mode.

[**-Wikipedia, Ketosis**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis)

Let's make it simpler.
When I use to play basketball my mum always made sure I eat a big plate of pasta before the match. Carbohydrates are an amazing resource of energy.
While we eat enough of them we will be in a **glycolysis** state. That means that our energy will come directly from the carbohydrates and the leftovers will be converted into fat.
But what happens when we don't eat enough carbohydrates? Then we get in to **ketosis** which does the exact opposite. In ketosis we convert our body fat in energy. This have to direct effects :

**Fat loss**: Your body gets converted in a fat burning machine. All the energy your body needs to run will come from fat (except your brain).

**Infinite energy:** while you have some fat, you wont run out of energy. You may have sleep deprivation or muscular fatigue but you won't be tired because your are low on energy.

These consequences by themself are amazing (lot more to come, don't leave!) ...but what happens with the carbohydrates then? Don't we need them?

### What's wrong with Carbohidrates?

We loooove carbohydrates (from now on CH). We are designed to love them! When we eat sugar (is a CH) our reward system activates , releasing dopamine and making us feel good and understand that sugar is great. That's why we like CH so much.

####Are they good or bad?
We (society) have a tendency in oversimplifing things and labeling them as "good" or "bad" and most of cases the response is "it depends".

We need them. Our brain runs enterly on 

Imagine how lifes were a milion years ago. Getting food was hard. If it was a cold winter humans may not get food for days. Our body created systems to survive these periods of food scarcity:

 - **A way to store energy:**  A.K.A. **Fat**. When we have abundance of energy we will just store it for when we need it.
 -  **A way to generate energy from different sources**. If it runs out of energy it will start converting the fat back to energy and even proteins if necessary.
 
Does are emergency systems


As explained before CH were not aboundant, but they were powerful because they had a lot of energy. And we want energy! That's why our body want them


###Ultra endurance
At that time I was fascinated with the idea behind the endurance running hypothesis:

I had read Bernd Heinrich's book [Why we run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Run) and Christopher's McDougall's [Born to run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen) where they suggest that we are super machines for ultra long distance running.

    The endurance running hypothesis is the hypothesis that the evolution of certain human characteristics can be explained as adaptations to long distance running. The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early hominins in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for persistence hunting.

[-Wikipedia, Endurance running hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_running_hypothesis)


But in their explanations there was a missing piece. How did they fuel? You can't just run for hours chasing animals at the hottest time of the day...

 [Bernd Heinrich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Heinrich), explains that to set the 100miles world record, he fueled himself with Cranberry Juice.
 **Soon after you run over 20km you will start running out of energy. About 90minutes of exercicing is when our bodies will run out of glycogen. [CHECK DATA]**
I don't think our ancestors had a support team feeding the hunters with juices or energy bars every few kilometers, they were running to get food in the first place...

The first time I heard the word "ketosis" was in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwvcrA7oe8) from Petter Attia.
The video is very technical and I did not understand half of it, and still I do not understand it now, but I got the basic idea of ketosis.
Now the *endurance running hypothesis* made sense. Humans were able to run hundrets of kilometers because were using fat as a source of energy and not the glycogen from carbohidrates.

Since I saw this video about an year an a half ago I became fascinated with ketosis. And this was just the start.

The problem. In our search for confort we isolated ourself from the natural enviroment so much that we no longer know what these aliments are.
The logic step then is to ask;
What do we use to eat before we radically transformed our natural habitat?

##What do we use to eat?
About 15.000 years ago we invented agriculture and started the domestication of animals. These enabled us to stop being nomads and feed massive ammounts of people. We created the first civilitzations and we start eating legumes, diary, and cereals.

Before that we were a hunter gathering society. 

In the last 50 years. We did another dramatic change on our food culture. We created a massive food industry that serves us with super tasty, long lasting, fast and easy to use food.


##The enemies
There are several factors that distort our natural instint to choose wisely.

###Information overload

####False  ilusion of understanding
Do you really understand what  vitamins, probiotics or antioxidants are? How they work? Most of us, don't. The industry and professionals use all these technical terms to justify their explanations. And we turst them (what else should we do?), their explanation "makes sense".  But we haven't understood anything. We just created an ilusion that we understand what this food will do in our bodies. So we can't justify or diatary choices other than "Because they say so".

####System trust failure
####The experts
I don't trust 99% of the "experts". Because the system we live on. It pushes them to deliver instant result from just an snapshot of our current state or otherwise they don't get paid. Lots of them also have found a comfortable spot on this sytem and they stopped learning. And we are talking about health. They will play safe using arguments accepted by the general public. 
The result is that if you go to the doctor they'll likely will recomend stuff based on generic dietary guidlines from 30 years ago.
#####The industry
Its key to understand that the food industry is not your friend. Except for very few, their goal is to sell to you as much stuff as they can. 
They are powerful and make use of main stream media to overload us with missleading statements and labeling.  And because its on TV they can't lie, right? 
EFSA and FDA, the european and american organisms to regulate and fight for our food safty are far away from doing their job. They serve the interest of the industry, not our health. And even if they want, they can't. Its just impossible to control food production, its to massive. There is just no way they can ensure the crops are not in an area where toxic waste was dumpt or that some farmer didn't put 10x the amount of pestiside allowed.

#####Inculture of information processing
We are so not use to information overload. So when we have to many or we are unable to fully understand it we simplify it by labeling as "good" or "bad". And there is not such a thing.  Something maybe better than some other thing in an specific context with specific quantities for an specific purpose. 

###Culture
What we always thought was right maybe wrong, really wrong. Food is a key part of any cuture. If you change your diet, you will be constantly questioned and asked for explanations, you won't find the "right" food in the stores or restaurants,  and you will have to cook yourself and start rethinking all the recepies you know...
Those are things that most people are not going to deal with.

###Pleasure
Food is not to please you! Is to keep you running.
We live in a society where instant gratification is the rule, and sacrifacing momentany desires for a long term health is not wired in our minds.

Gratification when eating is one of the ways nature have tell our body what and when to eat. And it had worked for thousands of years. Not anymore. We deformed our enviroment to isolate ourselfs from the external factors in exchange for confort. And with isolation we lost our natural instinct. What our brain tells us is good  (sugar?) maybe just poison. I'll go further with this subject later on.

####Carbohidrates

//With inteligence we create technology. And we use it to improve our lifes. At some point our primary needs got satisfied and then we stared using tecnology to create confort. Then everything got fucked up.

##The Paleo Answer
You've probably heard about the Paleo diet. It aims to replicate what our ancestors use to eat before we invented civilitzation.
