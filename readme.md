This is an under constrution post. If you have any comment it will be more than welcome.

In the past months I found myself dicussing  about food with almost everyone every single day. Its clear that there is a rise of awareness but with it, it comes, a rise of confusion. The amount of noise about what is "right" or "wrong" is just insane. What to eat is probably the widdest discussed subject in our society and one of our biggest problems we face.

With this post I want to provide a macro prespective of food. Give fundamental arguments, distilled information and  provide resources that can be use as an overall guidance to take better decisions.

I have no expertise in any of the related areas I'm about to touch. So, don't trust me. Common sense and the internet are your best friends. This blog post is just an starting point.

#What to eat

`Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.`
**-Leonardo da Vinci**

We are the product of millions of years of natural evolution. There is a reason to be how we are. So we must be designed to eat specific things. What are these things? Why we are not eating them?

##The enemies
There are several factors that distort our natural instint to choose wisely.

###Information overload
There is so much noise.

###The industry
Its key to understand that the food industry is not your friend. Except for very few, their goal is to sell to you as much stuff as they can. 
They are powerful and make use of main stream media to overload us with missleading statements and labeling.  And because its on TV they can't lie, right? EFSA and FDA, the european and american organisms to regulate and fight for our food safty are far away from doing their job. 


###Culture
What we always thought was right maybe wrong, really wrong. Food is a key part of any cuture. If you change your diet, you will be constantly questioned and asked for explanations, you won't find the "right" food in the stores or restaurants,  and you will have to cook yourself and start rethinking all the recepies you know...
Those are things that most people are not going to deal with.

###Pleasure
Food is not to please you! Is to keep you running.
But we live in a society were instant gratification is the rule, and sacrifacing momentany desires for a long term health is not wired in our minds.
Gratification when eating is one of the ways nature have tell our body what and when to eat. And it had worked for thousands of years. Not anymore. We deformed our enviroment to isolate ourselfs from the external factors and provide us with confort. These isolation have caused us the lost of natural instinct. What our brain tells us is good  (sugar?) maybe just poison. I'll go furthe with this subject later on.

With inteligence we create technology. And we use it to improve our lifes. At some point our primary needs got satisfied and then we stared using tecnology to create confort. Then everything got fucked up.
