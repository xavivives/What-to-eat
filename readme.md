This is an under constrution post. If you have any comment it will be more than welcome.

In the past months I found myself dicussing  about food with almost everyone every single day. Its clear that there is a rise of awareness but with it, it comes, a rise of confusion. The amount of noise about what is "right" or "wrong" is just insane. What to eat is probably the widdest discussed subject in our society and one of our biggest problems we face.

With this post I want to provide a macro prespective of food. Give fundamental arguments, distilled information and  provide resources that can be use as an overall guidance to take better decisions.

I have no expertise in any of the related areas I'm about to touch. So, don't trust me. Common sense and the internet are your best friends. This blog post is just an starting point.

#What to eat

`Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.`
**-Leonardo da Vinci**

We are the product of millions of years of natural evolution. There is a reason to be how we are. So we must be designed to eat specific things. What are these things? Why we are not eating them?

##The enemies
There are several factors that distort our natural instint to choose wisely.

###Information overload
There is so much noise.

###The industry
Its key to understand that the food industry is not your friend. Except for very few, their goal is to sell you as much stuff as they can. 
They'll use missleading statements and labels such as "Light", "Natural", "Bio" to make you think t
And they put a lot of money in marketing campaings 

###Culture

###Pleasure
It is not the main purpose of food to provide you with pleasure. Pleasure 


With inteligence we create technology. And we use it to improve our lifes. At some point our primary needs got satisfied and then we stared using tecnology to create confort. Then everything got fucked up.

Every animal in its own natural space knows what to eat
